    If table name is more than the limit of database >> cut off

    Default is the first row, but if the first row is all blank, next row will be used

    If column name is repeated, number like '0' will be added as its suffix
  ### How to define column type：
    Varchar(255) is default. If max length of column more than 255, text/clob will be set.
